## **Synopsis**
We are building a web application that will create **???** based on **???**. 

The user will **???**.

This application will take **???** as input

This application will output **???**.

The places will be displayed in order of easiest travel route while taking into account the hours
of operation of each attraction. Once a user creates their itinerary, they can add other users to
their trip. The application will also have a messaging feature so users can discuss and further
plan their upcoming trip together. As a whole, the application will serve to help the user develop
a concrete and efficient plan for their trip, as well as to aid sharing travel information with all
members of the party.
## Multiple Simultaneous Users Support
Each trip can be associated with multiple visitors(customers). Each visitor in turn can view the
trip itinerary and make suggestions about their preference in a group chat on the day-to-day
plan page.

## User Stories

1. As a customer, I can sign up for the application and sign in with my own username.

2. 

## Example Usages
????:

1. ???
2. ???
3. ???

## Possible Error Cases

1. 

## Static Analysis

We will use  Pylint  which is a python static analysis tool for error detection and bug checking.

## Unit Test Tool

We will use  unittest  (Unit Testing Framework in Python) to build and run a collection of test cases for our application.
## Build Tool
PyBuilder will be used to construct build life cycles for our Python application.
## Package Manager
We will use pip for managing all python packages.

## Technical Specifications
We will use a web application framework - Python Flask for backend, Bootstrap for frontend,
and PostgreSQL database. We will implement ElasticSearch+SparkMLlib(might use an open
server framework provided by Prediction.IO) to realize our itinerary recommendation system.
We will use the Google Maps/Places APIs to gather metadata for the tourist attractions per
location.
